Sometimes, tools with too many options are obstacles in GTD (Getting Things Done)...
esp. when user - in most likelihood - uses a small subset of options in day-to-day
work.

This tool aims to simplify user interaction with issue & project tracking tools.
Though, initially developed for JIRA, it could easily be refactored to work with
any other tool providing REST APIs.

## Status
Early development.

## Features Planned

1) Angular Material based UI
1) Choice of multiple backend engines
   1) ExpressJS
   1) Python
1) Works with JIRA server instance
   * Includes a fake data provider to test without real server
